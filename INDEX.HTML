<section id="components">
    <h2>Key Components of a Computer</h2>
    <p>Modern computers are made up of several key components that work together to execute tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> The brain of the computer, which performs calculations and executes instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Temporary memory used to store data that is actively being used.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Long-term memory (e.g., hard drives, SSDs) used to store files and software.</li>
        <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board that connects all the components of the computer.</li>
    </ul>
